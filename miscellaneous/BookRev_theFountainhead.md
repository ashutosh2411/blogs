The story of an Individual, fighting for survival; the most beautiful woman, struggling for her love; the owner of the most powerful newspaper empire, turning to ruins: The Fountainhead, is a masterpiece by Ayn Rand. Rand’s uncanny ability to weave words into a beautiful mosaic leave the characters dancing on the pages of the book. Flawless characterization, intriguing plot twists and full of head scratching moments, The Fountainhead, published in 1943 is Rand’s first major literary breakthrough.

I read the fountainhead the last summer break and that was one of the most desirable and life altering emotional turmoils of my life. The number of pages: 753 was successful to in making me groan; but eventually i finished it. It took a while for me to finish it. Worth every minute spent!

At moments, you’ll struggle to keep going thru the book. You may find it easier to finish the TV series you have brought rather than to continue to strain your nerves. You continuously find yourself on the verge of giving up, but if you make it – WHAT A VIEW!

It seldom happens that you sit for mere pleasure, read for the sake of pleasure and you encounter the ideologies, the views that challenge the ones held earlier. The Fountainhead did that. Apart from challenging my ethics, The Fountainhead altered them. It made me realize that how a man could be as great as he wants to be and how achievement is our ultimate goal.
