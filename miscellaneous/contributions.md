# Pull Requests
I am a strong supporter of Free and Open Source Software. 

I don't have any merged Pull Requests, however, following are some of my open-source projects apart from those done in my courses. 

Besides, creating is more fun than contributing. _JK_

## 1. Stock Market Predictions: _(not course)_
Predicting stock and equity trends is a non-trivial task. Implemented various machine learning techniques to predict interday trends. 
* Validating available data.
* Computing various technical indicators. 
* Implementing machine learning models and searching in a grid for optimal parameters.

## 2. SlideShare scraper: _(not course)_
There were a few presentations on SlideShare which were disabled to download. 
* I wrote a simple Python script to download the images.
* Initially, I did a sequential download of the files, but that took forever, so I introduced threading.
* Then, I made a PDF of those images, thus generating the slide.

## 3. Image Scraper: _(not course)_
The main idea of this project was to have something like a universal image scraper.
* Implemented the Instagram scraper.
* Other scrapers, Pinterest, Facebook to be added in future.

## 4. LinkedInScraper: _(not course)_
I am not obsessed with scrapers, but I don't see the point in the unavailability of those! So, I create my own.
* This started off as a data-entry automation project. 
* A start-up contacted me to purchase the software.
* I sold it to them for 10,000. I don't believe in monetizing software until it is being used for monetary purposes. 
* LinkedIn blocks requests from wget or other retrievers. So, I had to fake human behaviour by a robot browser, selenium. 
* It was a pretty exciting project and could be improved on. 
* I decided to make it open-source because I believe it could be improved further.

## 5. Future Project: thought now
Lack of descent MD to PDF converters.
* encountered while writing this summary.
* There was no descent MD to PDF converter, which parses basic MD stuff to a PDF.
* I had to convert it to HTML page and then Print the page!
* https://github.com/ashutosh2411/MDtoPDF repo currently empty.
